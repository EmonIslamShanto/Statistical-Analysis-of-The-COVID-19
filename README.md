COVID-19 Data Analysis Using R

Overview
This project performs a statistical analysis of COVID-19 patient data to evaluate claims about death rates, age, and gender using R. The dataset contains information on patients, including their age, gender, and death status. This analysis involves cleaning the data, calculating death rates, comparing the ages of deceased and surviving patients, and assessing the impact of gender on death rates.

Project Structure
The project includes the following files:

covid19_analysis.R: R script that contains the code for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and hypothesis testing.
COVID19_line_list_data.csv: The dataset used for the analysis.
README.md: This file, providing details about the project, analysis process, and instructions to run the R script.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains patient data, including the following columns:

age: The age of the patient.
gender: The gender of the patient.
death: Whether the patient survived or not.
Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are:

Death Rate Calculation: Compute the overall death rate of COVID-19 patients.
Age Analysis: Compare the average age of deceased and surviving patients to test if older people are more likely to die.
Gender Analysis: Test if gender affects the probability of death due to COVID-19.
Dependencies
To run the R script, the following dependencies are required:

R (version 3.x or higher)
Hmisc library for descriptive statistics
readr library to read CSV data
You can install the necessary R packages using the following commands:

r
Copy code
install.packages("Hmisc")
install.packages("readr")
Analysis Breakdown
1. Data Cleaning
Death Dummy Variable: A new variable death_dummy is created where:
1 indicates the patient has died.
0 indicates the patient has survived.
r
Copy code
data$death_dummy <- as.integer(data$death != 0)
2. Death Rate Calculation
The overall death rate is calculated as the ratio of deceased patients to the total number of patients:

r
Copy code
sum(data$death_dummy) / nrow(data)
3. Age Analysis
Claim: People who die are generally older.
Mean Age of Deceased vs. Alive: The mean age of deceased and surviving patients is calculated.
Statistical Significance: A two-sided t-test is performed to test if the age difference between deceased and alive patients is statistically significant:
r
Copy code
t.test(alive$age, dead$age, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.99)
If the p-value < 0.05, the null hypothesis (that age has no effect) is rejected, concluding that age is a significant factor.

4. Gender Analysis
Claim: Gender has no effect on death rates.
Death Rate by Gender: The mean death rate for men and women is compared.
Statistical Significance: A two-sided t-test is performed to test if the difference in death rates between men and women is statistically significant:
r
Copy code
t.test(men$death_dummy, women$death_dummy, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.99)
Results show that men have a statistically higher chance of dying, with a p-value < 0.05.

Running the Analysis
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-analysis.git
Open the R script (covid19_analysis.R) in RStudio or run it directly in R.

Run the script to perform the analysis:

r
Copy code
source("covid19_analysis.R")
The results of the death rate, age analysis, and gender analysis will be printed in the console.

Results
Death Rate: The overall death rate of the dataset is calculated.
Age Analysis: Older patients are found to have a significantly higher death rate (p-value < 0.05).
Gender Analysis: Men are statistically more likely to die than women, with a confidence interval showing a 0.8% to 8.8% higher chance of death for men.
